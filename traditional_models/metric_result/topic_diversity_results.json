However, six partial overlaps (40–62 %) show thematic inter-linkages: conflict-refugee flows, conflict-terrorism, rights-elections, disaster-health emergencies, climate-disaster, and arms-economics. These overlaps reflect real-world policy nexuses rather than redundancy. Overall diversity score of 0.83 indicates a well-spread agenda with distinct core issues; further granularity (e.g., splitting conflict drivers from humanitarian response) could raise diversity even higher.",
